                    <p>This project is designed for anyone who loves Dungeons & Dragons(D&D). D&D can sometimes be a bit more work than it's worth. So I created this website for anyone who needs to create a hord of badguys in a flash.

                        Character Generator demonstrates my ability to use Object Oriented Programming and polymorphism. Using simple JavaScript I created classes and subclasses representing diffent types of enemies. This allowed all enemies to share similar attributes and abilities (properties and methods).

                        Additianly, I began to allow for some user preferences using global state variables through Redux. I have sence updated my code to manage state variables using Recoil.

                        This website was created using PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. the purpose of my personal portfolio website is to show my profitiency with front end developement and showcase other projects.

                        While working on this project I learned very much about interactive web design. I use clip paths and transitions to make my website more interesting along with some svg manipulation for some fun scrolling effects.
                        <!-- <br> -->
                        Also, I have built a mock chat-box that can be used to ask some get to know me questions in the bottom right corner of this page. This was built in PHP and queries a SQL database through and AJAX request.
