                    My wife Daisy is so great! We are best friends and enjoy vollyball, rock climbing, skiing, and scuba diving together. I met Daisy while we were both serving as missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

                    I love playing volyball with my wife. We play every Monday night with a group of friends and it's a blast. While vollyball is fun I most enjoy scubadiving. This is a picture of my wife and me on our first dive trip together. I have been a diver since 2016 but only get to dive while on vacation. My dream is to one day own a home near the beach and swim in the ocean every day.

                    Because I dont live near the ocean and can't dive very freqiently I started to learn how to spear fish. Spear fishing quickly grew to be one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy playing video games with my wife and father. We mainly play first person shooters and it's a lot of fun.

                I also needed to do a minimal amount of front end developement that allowed an admin user to request information with a simple form submission.
                    Continuing my profetional career as a web developer I began working at Ascend Education as a backend developer. While working at Ascend Education I became proficciant in php and improved my front web design techniques.
